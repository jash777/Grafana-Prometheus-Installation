## 🔍 Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a robust monitoring solution using:

- **Prometheus**: An open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit
- **Grafana**: A multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application
- **Node Exporter**: A Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics

Whether you're a system administrator, DevOps engineer, or a curious learner, this guide will help you establish a solid foundation for monitoring your infrastructure.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Linux-based system (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later recommended)
- Root or sudo access
- Basic familiarity with the command line
- An active internet connection

## 📚 Installation Steps

Our guide covers the following main sections:

1. Installing Prometheus
2. Installing Grafana
3. Setting up Node Exporter
4. Configuring Prometheus to scrape Node Exporter metrics

Each section includes detailed commands with explanations. Visit our [Installation Guide](https://jash777.github.io/Grafana-Prometheus-Installation/) for the full instructions.

## 💻 Usage

After following the installation guide, you'll have:

- Prometheus running and collecting metrics
- Grafana set up for creating dashboards
- Node Exporter providing system-level metrics

You can then:

1. Access Prometheus at `http://your-server-ip:9090`
2. Access Grafana at `http://your-server-ip:3000`
3. Start creating dashboards in Grafana using Prometheus as a data source
